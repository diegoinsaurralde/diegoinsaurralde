I would describe myself in three words as a self-taught, proactive and decisive person.
  I like technology in general, feeling that every day I am better because I learn something new.
  
Currently I am perfecting myself as a frontend learning the most important technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Bootstrap, Jquery, RXJS, Angular). I am also interested in the backend to be a more complete developer and better understand how both sides work.
I am currently studying the English language with the goal of reaching a good level, but also as something personal because I like the idea of speaking it.

I am looking to collaborate in a work team that allows me to apply and at the same time improve my skills as a frontend with experience. I have very good skills for teamwork, communication, active listening and stress management.

My favorite hobbies are working on personal projects, riding a bike, playing chess and reading.
